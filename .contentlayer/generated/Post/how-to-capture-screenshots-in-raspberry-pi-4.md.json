Gnome Screenshot provides a graphical interface. You use a graphical interface to take screenshots very easily.\n\nOther hands scort is a command-line tool, and scort does not provide any graphical interface.So I'm personally again recommended you use Gnome Screenshot.\n\n### Install Gnome Screenshot in Raspbian or Raspberry pi 4:\n\n**let start it:**\n\nThe Raspi 4 does not provide by default Gnome Screenshot.\n\nFirstly Update your raspberry pi 4. this is a compulsory step for installing Gnome Screenshot.\n\n```cmd\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade\n```\n\nYour update and upgrade command run successfully. Now you install Gnome Screenshot following command.\n\n```cmd\nsudo apt install gnome-screenshot\n```\n\nNow you can find Gnome Screenshot in your accessories menu, listed as \"Screenshot.\"\n\n![sceenshot](http://localhost:3000/images/geenome.png)\n\n\nGnome interface is very easy to understand. You use Gnome to get a Screenshot, add your own image name, and after save it. By default, all pic save inside your Picture folder.\n\n![interface look like](http://localhost:3000/images/gnome-screenshots.png)\n\n\n---\n\n### Uninstall Gnome Screenshot:\n\nIn some cases, you may uninstall the Gnome Screenshot. so follow this command\n\n```cmd\nsudo apt-get remove --purge gnome-screenshot\n```\n\n---\n\n# Contact me\n\n* [https://www.facebook.com/officialrajdeepsingh/](https://www.facebook.com/officialrajdeepsingh/)\n* [https://medium.com/officialrajdeepsingh](https://medium.com/officialrajdeepsingh)\n* [officialrajdeepsingh@gmail.com](mailto:officialrajdeepsingh@gmail.com)\n\n\n\n",
